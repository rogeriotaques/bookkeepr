# BookKeepr

BookKeepr - _/ˈbo͝o(k)ˌkēpər/_ - is a macOS bookkeeping app for small businesses and self-employed professionals in Japan. Designed to be simple and easy.

Supports both `single-entry` and `double-entry` methods.

## What is bookkeeping?

It is the recording of financial transactions, and is part of the process of accounting in business and other organizations. It involves preparing source documents for all transactions, operations, and other events of a business.

Transactions include purchases, sales, receipts and payments by an individual person or an organization/corporation. There are several standard methods of bookkeeping, including the single-entry and double-entry bookkeeping systems.

While these may be viewed as "real" bookkeeping, any process for recording financial transactions is a bookkeeping process.
